# GpsTrackTools
A collection of Python code for processing NMEA GPS tracks.

After I found my fitbit busted up and lying in the gutter, I had a new mission. Make my own fitness tracker.
I'm a big fan of the Adafruit company for DIY electronics. So I bought a bunch of parts from them and made
a Arduino based GPS logger. I had intended to use it for keeping track of my jogging stats. But then I ran into
some mission creep. I started just taking the logger with me everywhere. The tracker dumps NMEA sentences to an
SD card. I then used these bits of Python code to crunch the track info into something I found meaningful. If 
you find anything useful, feel free to clone it fork it or whatever floats your boat.
